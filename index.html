      <h2>1. Student Grade Generator</h2>
      <p>A student grade generator is a software tool or program designed to automate the process of generating grades for students based on their average performance in various assessments, such as tests, assignments, projects, and participation.</p>

      <h2>2. Speed Detector</h2>
      <p>The program takes the speed value obtained from the speed detector as input and then calculates the demerit points based on the provided logic. The speed is compared to the designated speed limit, and if the vehicle exceeds the limit, appropriate actions such as issuing warnings, or demerit points may be implemented to encourage drivers to adhere to the speed regulations.</p>
    
      <form> 
          <!-- Label for the input field -->
          <label for="vehicle-reg">Vehicle Reg.:</label><br>

      <h2>3. Net Salary Calculator</h2>
      <p>The Net Salary Calculator is a program that takes into account an employee's basic salary and benefits to calculate the final amount they will receive as their net salary. It considers various deductions such as Payee Tax, NHIF, and NSSF to arrive at the net salary, which is the actual amount the employee takes home after all deductions are accounted for.</p>
