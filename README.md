# Phase One Code Challenge

This project consists of three code challenges: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

## Student Grade Generator

The Student Grade Generator is a software tool designed to automate the process of generating grades for students based on their average performance in various assessments, such as tests, assignments, projects, and participation.

To use the Student Grade Generator:
1. Enter the student's name in the "Student Name" input field.
2. Enter the student's marks (percentage) in the "Marks" input field.
3. Click the "GRADE" button to calculate the grade.
4. The student's name and grade will be displayed in an alert.

## Speed Detector

The Speed Detector program takes the speed value obtained from a speed detector as input and calculates the demerit points based on the provided logic. It compares the speed to the designated speed limit and takes appropriate actions, such as issuing warnings, or demerit points, to encourage drivers to adhere to the speed regulations.

To use the Speed Detector:
1. Enter the vehicle registration number in the "Vehicle Reg." input field.
2. Enter the detected speed in kilometers per hour (KMPH) in the "Speed" input field.
3. Click the "SPEED GOVERNOR" button to perform the speed detection.
4. An alert will be displayed with the vehicle registration and demerit points (if applicable).
