# Phase One Code Challenge

This project consists of three code challenges: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

The Student Grade Generator helps to calculate and assign grades to students based on their performance in different assessments. It simplifies the grading process and ensures consistency in evaluating the academic grades.

The Speed Detector program is a tool that helps to monitor and enforce speed limits. By inputting the detected speed of a vehicle, the program determines if any penalties or warnings should be issued, encouraging safe driving.

The Net Salary Calculator helps in determining an employee's net salary. It considers various deductions, such as taxes and contributions, to calculate the final amount the employee will receive after deductions have been made.

## Student Grade Generator

The Student Grade Generator is a software tool designed to automate the process of generating grades for students based on their average performance in various assessments, such as tests, assignments, projects, and participation.

To use the Student Grade Generator:
1. Enter the student's name in the "Student Name" input field.
2. Enter the student's marks (percentage) in the "Marks" input field.
3. Click the "GRADE" button to calculate the grade.
4. The student's name and grade will be displayed in an alert.

## Speed Detector

The Speed Detector program takes the speed value obtained from a speed detector as input and calculates the demerit points based on the provided logic. It compares the speed to the designated speed limit and takes appropriate actions, such as issuing warnings, or demerit points, to encourage drivers to adhere to the speed regulations.

To use the Speed Detector:
1. Enter the vehicle registration number in the "Vehicle Reg." input field.
2. Enter the detected speed in kilometers per hour (KMPH) in the "Speed" input field.
3. Click the "SPEED GOVERNOR" button to perform the speed detection.
4. An alert will be displayed with the vehicle registration and demerit points.

## Net Salary Calculator

The Net Salary Calculator is a program that takes into account an employee's basic salary and benefits to calculate the final amount they will receive as their net salary. It considers various deductions such as Payee Tax, NHIF, and NSSF to arrive at the net salary, which is the actual amount the employee takes home after all deductions.

To use the Net Salary Calculator:
1. Enter the employee's name in the "Employee Name" input field.
2. Enter the basic salary amount in Kenyan Shillings (KSH) in the "Basic Salary" input field.
3. Click the corresponding buttons ("PAYE", "NHIF DEDUCTION", "NSSF DEDUCTION", "NET SALARY") to perform the respective calculations.
4. Alerts will be displayed with the employee's name and the calculated values for each deduction and the net salary.
